/**
 * Bundle the compiled extension entry (`dist/index.js`) into a single
 * self-contained ESM file, inlining pure-JS runtime dependencies.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * pi ships as a `bun build --compile` single-file executable and loads
 * extensions inside that embedded runtime. That runtime's module resolver does
 * not traverse an extension's on-disk `node_modules` for a BARE specifier (e.g.
 * `import "minimatch"`), so analyzers that transitively import third-party deps
 * (minimatch via `file-utils.js` -> jscpd/todo/complexity) fail to load
 * ("Cannot find package 'minimatch' …") and drop to degraded mode. Bundling
 * inlines those deps so the extension imports nothing by bare specifier at load
 * time. Runs after `tsc` (build:dist) has produced `dist/`; bundles in place.
 *
 * KEPT EXTERNAL (not inlined)
 *   The list lives in ./lib/host-provided-deps.mjs, which is also what
 *   package.json's dependency shape and tests/packaging.test.ts are pinned to
 *   (#1926). Two reasons a package is external:
 *   - Host-provided: pi resolves it from its own embedded runtime, so the
 *     extension must NOT declare it as a runtime dependency.
 *   - Native addon / wasm loaded lazily by absolute path at call time.
 *   node: builtins are external by default.
 *
 * esbuild is run through `npm exec` (resolved from npm's own CLI so there is no
 * npx `.cmd` shim and no shell), the same resolve-your-own-toolchain approach
 * build:dist uses for tsc (#437): esbuild installs into npm's cache, never the
 * project tree, so this adds no dependency and works under a from-source
 * `--omit=dev` install where project devDeps are absent. This relies on npm's
 * `exec --package` syntax; pi always installs via npm so the shipping path is
 * npm. A non-npm `npm_execpath` (pnpm/yarn/bun) is rejected with a clear error.
 *
 * WHY `--prefix` AND NOT A DIFFERENT `cwd` (#2590, #2594 review F1)
 * The isolation mechanism (`npm exec --package` resolves against the WHOLE
 * project dependency tree unless steered elsewhere) is shared with
 * `scripts/build-dist-tsc.mjs`'s tsc spawn (#2593) — see
 * scripts/lib/exec-isolation.mjs for the full mechanism writeup and both
 * call sites' shared builder.
 *
 * A first attempt at this fix moved the spawn's `cwd` to a temp directory,
 * which also moves npm's `runPath` (it defaults to `process.cwd()`) — but
 * esbuild bakes its bundled-module-path banner COMMENTS relative to ITS OWN
 * cwd, so that shipped a `dist/index.js` with hundreds of machine- and
 * worktree-specific relative paths (`// ../../home/<user>/...`) baked into
 * it, a different artifact than master's (see tests/packaging.test.ts's
 * "bakes no user-profile absolute path into the bundle").
 *
 * The actual fix: keep the spawn's `cwd` (and therefore `runPath`) at
 * `root`, and pass `--prefix <freshly created empty temp dir>` on the npm
 * CLI invocation instead (see scripts/lib/exec-isolation.mjs). `distEntry`
 * and the esbuild `--outfile` are both already absolute paths, so nothing
 * about esbuild's OUTPUT changes; the fix touches only what npm's exec
 * resolution can see, never what esbuild itself runs from.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/bundle-dist.mjs   # invoked by `npm run bundle:dist`
