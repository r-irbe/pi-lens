/**
 * Generation lock: cross-process mutual exclusion that never removes a lock
 * by path (#3476). The TLC-checked design is
 * `formal/file-locks/GenerationLock.tla`.
 *
 * The lock is a directory of files `lock.1`, `lock.2`, … The holder is the
 * creator of the highest generation while that file is neither released
 * (`lock.<g>.released` exists) nor stale (its owner pid is dead, or its mtime
 * is older than the lease). Every acquisition, a stale takeover included, is
 * an exclusive create of the next generation, so of several takers that
 * judged the same generation stale exactly one create succeeds. The old
 * pid-file locks removed the stale lock by path instead, and a taker acting
 * on an earlier judgement could remove a live successor's lock.
 *
 * The generation is created with `wx` and its pid written in the same call,
 * not linked from a written temp file: hard links fail on FAT/exFAT and some
 * network shares (the reason #3475 kept `wx`). A reader that meets the
 * generation before its pid is written reads it as live until its mtime
 * passes the lease, the rule #3475 gave the bounded lock, so the empty window
 * can only delay a takeover, never admit one.
